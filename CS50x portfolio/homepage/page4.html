            <p class="step"> Step 1 </p>
            <p> Bring a pan of salted water to a rapid boil, then lower four of the eggs into the pan and simmer for 7 mins 30 secs exactly.<br>
                 Scoop out and place in a bowl of iced water, cracking the shells a little (this makes them easier to peel later). Leave them <br>
                 to cool completely, then peel and set aside. Can be boiled the day before.</p>
            <p class="step"> Step 2</p>
            <p> Put the sausagemeat, pepper, ham, stuffing and herbs in a small bowl, mix to combine, then divide into four equal balls. Squash<br>
                 one of the balls between a piece of cling film until it's as flat as possible. One at a time, lightly flour each cooked egg, <br>
                 then use the cling film to help roll the sausagemeat around the egg to completely encase. Repeat with the remaining sausageballs <br>
                 and eggs.</p>
            <p class="step"> Step 3 </p>
            <p> Beat the remaining egg and put on a plate. Put the flour and breadcrumbs on two separate plates. Roll the encased eggs in the flour, <br>
                then the beaten egg and finally the breadcrumbs. Can be prepared up to a day in advance.</p>
            <p class="step"> Step 4 </p>
            <p> To cook the eggs, heat 5cm of the oil in a wide saucepan or wok until it reaches 160C on a cooking thermometer or until a few <br>
                breadcrumbs turn golden after 10 secs in the oil. Depending on the size of your pan, lower as many eggs as you can into the oil,<br>
                 and cook for 8-10 mins until golden and crispy. Drain on kitchen paper, leave to cool a little, then serve halved with some <br>
                 piccalilli.</p>
